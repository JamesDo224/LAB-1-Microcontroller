# LAB-1-Microcontroller
The most interest of STM32CubeIDE is that after the selection of an empty STM32 MCU or MPU, or preconfigured microcontroller or microprocessor from the selection of a board, the initialization code generated automatically. At any time during the development, the user can return to the initialization and configuration of the peripherals or middleware and regenerate the initialization code with no impact on the user code. This feature can simplify the initialization process and speedup the development application running on STM32 micro-controller.
